      <p>Hi there ðŸ‘‹ ... this is FreeBeeGee running in demo mode. This means we won't use a server - we store your rooms &amp; tables in your browser. But without a real server, a few things can't work:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>You can't invite other players to your room.</li>
        <li>You can't edit the library.</li>
        <li>You can't save your room as <code>.zip</code>.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Other than that, all features should be working. Go ahead and check out what FreeBeeGee can do for you!</p>
      <p>If you don't allow your browser store site data &amp; cookies when closing, all you do here will be gone by then. Otherwise you might be able to reopen your room later - just don't rely on it to be there. It's a demo after all.</p>
